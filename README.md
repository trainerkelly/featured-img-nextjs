# Featured Image Sizing Demonstration (NextJS Version)

The NextJS version of [Featured Images Sizes](https://github.com/trainerkelly/Featured-Image-Sizes).

It's demonstrating a solution to bad Featured Image cropping when that Featued Image is used for both vertical and horiztonal (which may not always work).

## About the Original Project

I had been part of a meeting my job and a part of the discussion was about a poorly positioned Featured Image. There was a lengthy discussion about a solution to the problem.

While I didn't have one for immediately fixing it, I was pretty clear on a long-term solution.

I wanted to make a demonstration though.

(This is actually a stripped down version of what I was originally going to do in order to focus on the simulating the features, not actually implementing them.)

### Why Bootstrap

Day job appears to use Bootstrap.

I don't like Bootstrap. 😂

## The NextJS Version

I was chugging along with the original when I realized that I was either going to need a backend or some sort of state management to make the idea work.

I could do it in plain ol' JavaScript, but it seemed like it would be more efficient to just use React.

I decided NextJS specific because I'm already familiar with it and if I wanted to take advantage of any features (like routing), I can do so.

That's why this respository exists.
